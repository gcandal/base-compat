# base-compat

A new version of [base.gov.pt ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹](https://www.base.gov.pt/Base4/) released on 2021 meant that existing links no longer work, even if the documents they pointed to still exist on the platform.

base-compat is an attempt to bridge the gap between the two base.gov.pt versions by:

- Providing a backwards-compatible lookup
- Converting references in text from the previous format to the new one
